Problem Statement 1 : StreamSync

🚀 Hackathon Challenge: "StreamSync – Personalized Streaming, Perfectly Timed"
🎬 The Real Scenario
It actually happened. The world tuned in for the epic Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight on Netflix. The knockout moment arrived—and Netflix lagged right then. Millions missed the action. The frustration was real.
Even the biggest streaming giants face challenges under massive loads. During the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023, 59 million viewers watched simultaneously, setting a world record. Handling such huge concurrency without lag is still a complex challenge.
But here’s your unique mission:
✅ User schedules? Already known.
✅ All videos? Pre-stored and ready.
✅ Personalized video sequences? Pre-calculated for each user—like Instagram Reels.
✅ Global stream kickoff time? 00:00 Hours.
🚨 Optimization of compute and storage? A must-have.
Now comes the real test:
No matter when a user logs in—whether at 00:00, 00:15, or 03:00—they must see exactly the video they’re supposed to be watching at that moment in their personalized sequence, as if they had been watching from the start.

💡 Your Challenge
Design a scalable and cost-efficient streaming system that:
Syncs personalized video streams to a global timeline.
Delivers lag-free playback for millions of users—anytime they join.
Optimizes compute and storage without compromising user experience.
🔍 Key Problems to Solve:
How will you synchronize streams for late joiners so they pick up the exact video in their sequence without manual seeking?
How can you ensure uninterrupted streams without buffering when millions log in at unpredictable times?
How will you minimize compute usage and storage costs while handling massive concurrent streams?
What smart caching, pre-fetching, and load-balancing strategies will you implement for optimal performance?
⚡ Why This Challenge Stands Out
Perfect Timing for Everyone: Users logging in at any time must see the exact video corresponding to the global schedule.
Massive Scale, Zero Lag: Millions of personalized streams running concurrently—can your solution handle the load?
No Rewinds, No Waiting: The stream doesn’t pause—users must instantly join the flow without buffering or manual adjustments.
Efficiency at Scale: Delivering this experience while optimizing compute and storage is the real deal-breaker.
🌐 What You’ll Be Building
A system that dynamically syncs pre-stored video chunks to a global timeline.
Real-time adaptive streaming for buttery-smooth playback tailored to each user.
Efficient load balancing and CDN strategies for global, concurrent streaming.
Compute and storage-optimized workflows to ensure scalability without skyrocketing costs.
🔥 Are You Ready?
The world has seen what happens when streaming fails. Now it’s your turn to show how it should be done—flawless, synchronized, and cost-efficient.
